# AirportCurrencyExchangeOfficeApp

Built using [simple-react-full-stack](https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack).

Note that due to having the simple subscription plan for the Currency Layer API (Currex is not available anymore), it does not allow HTTPS requests. In order to see the webpage without currency errors, visit the app's link using HTTP.

I sticked to the defined implementation and did not go over deeper requirements, primarily due to my lack of knowledge of the currency exchange market and time to research about it/implement further requirements.

Also, I am a noobie in TypeScript (I generally use Babel) and I failed to use the `tslint.json`. I centered my time more in the general implementation rather than touching the already premade [simple-react-full-stack](https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack) architecture. However, I generally try to keep my code clean and consistent, as you will see.

That's about it concerning any unfortunate lacks in this project. You can find the code under `src/client`, along with a `tree.info` to explain the architecture of the project. The configuration file is under the folder `src/client/data`.

Cheers,
Martin
