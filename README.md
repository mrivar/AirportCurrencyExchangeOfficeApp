# AirportCurrencyExchangeOfficeApp

Built using [simple-react-full-stack](https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack).

Note that due to having the simple subscription plan for the Currency Layer API (Currex is not available anymore), it does not allow HTTPS requests. In order to see the webpage without currency errors, visit the app's link using HTTP.

You can find the code under `src/client`, along with a `tree.info` to explain the architecture of the project. The configuration file is under the folder `src/client/data`.
